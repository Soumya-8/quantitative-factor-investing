# Quantitative Factor Investing Strategy 📈

This project implements a **2-Factor Quantitative Investing strategy** using Momentum and Volatility to select top Indian stocks from the Nifty50 universe.

---

## 🔍 Strategy Overview

We compute:
- 📊 **6-Month Momentum** (past performance)
- ⚖️ **6-Month Volatility** (risk level)

We then combine the ranks of both to select the **top 3 stocks**, equally weighted, and simulate the portfolio growth.

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- yfinance (data)
- pandas, NumPy (data analysis)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)
